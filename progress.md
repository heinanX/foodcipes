**Upcoming Tasks:**

- search form
- individual recipe page
- carousel
- index filtering
- accessability
- add a /search page ?

**Init Thoughts About Pages:**
/ = holds different categories (carousels) and also a search form.
/recipes = holds an index feature
/:id = holds a single recipe

**Day 1: Project setup and inital structure build.**
I have created the initial pages needed for the recipe collection.
Where I left off is in the pages file for Home, where I am fetching the data from Sanity and storing it inside a variable. I haven't refined the fetch yet.

**Next up:** work on fetching the correct data and how to present it.
